/// Entry 1 ///
Added ProgressNotes.txt to better keep track of edits.
Adding http logging:
    Added "...HttpLoggingMiddleware": "Information" to appsettings.Development.json to show http logging.

Attribute routing issues:
    Learned how routes applied to the controller and routes applied to the controllers methods work together.
    Now the attribute routing is implemented correctly for the HomeController

Added a test controller and view

Added images/favicon.jpg and corrisponding tag in _Layout.cshtml to include it.
