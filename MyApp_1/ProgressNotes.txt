/// Entry 1 ///
Added ProgressNotes.txt to better keep track of edits.
Adding http logging:
    Added "...HttpLoggingMiddleware": "Information" to appsettings.Development.json to show http logging.

Attribute routing issues:
    Learned how routes applied to the controller and routes applied to the controllers methods work together.
    Now the attribute routing is implemented correctly for the HomeController

Added a test controller and view

Added images/favicon.jpg and corrisponding tag in _Layout.cshtml to include it.

/// Entry 2 ///
LOOK INTO "CSS ISOLATION" !!!!!

Removed @page tag from .cshtml files because its not supposed to be there in an MVC and was causing issues.

Added Users controller and some views.
Going to inject MyApp_1DbContext and mess with it a bit:
    Got the UsersController to finally extract some data from the database.
